# Days at Three Branches agent

Edit `agent.py` to give every one of your villagers a routine. The platform runs a separate `Agent` instance for each NPC, so instances do not share variables or memory. The supplied `sandbox/` directory contains the local runner, types, and village helpers. Leave it unchanged, and leave `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` alone: the pinned packages match the server.

Start with the [Getting Started guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/getting-started/). Then run these commands from this folder:

```console
python -m sandbox watch  # watch your villagers and the scripted visitor
python -m sandbox test   # run the checks
python -m sandbox eval   # run repeatable automated days
```

## Files you will use

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `agent.py` | Your `Agent` implementation and starter TODOs. |
| `environment.md` | Rules, helpers, observations, and local commands. |
| `manifest.json` | Tells Game Sandbox where the agent class lives. |
| `season.json` | Optional local season settings downloaded from My Submissions. |
| `tests/` | Checks your submission should pass. |
| `sandbox/` | Local game, helpers, and types. Do not edit it. |
| `requirements.txt` | Exact Python package versions used by the server. |
| `requirements-dev.txt` | Test dependencies. |
| `.env.example` | Example local LLM settings. |

The starter shows `action.walk`, `action.stand`, an emote, and `use`. Read [`environment.md`](environment.md) before changing it. Begin with one behavior that you can recognize in `watch`, then make it more responsive to the people and props it sees.

Chat is optional. If you add `chat(self, inbox)` to your agent, send and receive raw message dictionaries that use canonical player IDs such as `"player_0"` and `"player_1"`. For example, return `[{"to": "player_0", "text": "Hello."}]` to send a direct message. The village helpers do not include a chat namespace. Read [`environment.md`](environment.md#chat-with-other-agents) for the inbox format, broadcasts, and delivery timing.

In `watch` and `eval`, your `Agent` controls the whole cast, and `scripted_visitor` controls the visitor. The `naive` built-in is the simple baseline for the cast. When you are ready to submit, follow the [submitting guide](https://vox-deorum.github.io/game-sandbox/students/submitting/).

## Optional LLM API

If your instructor enables model calls, follow [Using the LLM API](llm.md). Copy `.env.example` to `.env`, add the endpoint and key, and never commit either secret.

Test the connection with:

```console
python -m sandbox llm
```

## AI-use discolosure and reflection

I used ChatGPT to update my Three Branches agent so that the agents now have a group of tasks they will perform while also navigating the village in a thoughtful manner - they should also take breaks in between tasks. ChatGPT made the code changes; and I did not make additional manual edits. I reviewed the new agent, checked the helpers against the environment page, and tested it against the seeds before and after each change. The new agent now performs as wanted for the design goal.

# Design Goal

My design goal for this agent was: For the RPG game, players should notice the villagers tend to different tasks throughout the day, interact with other villagers and the player, and take short breaks for small chores or chatting.
